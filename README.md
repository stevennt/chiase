# Good concept from the Malaysian friends. Thanks for the dev team. Building one for Vietnam would makes a lot of sense.

## Usage
Members of our community can post a picture through this web app if they see a white flag nearby and it will be displayed on a map, so that anyone on the internet can help those in need.  Users of the app can also view the white flags posted in under a 10 KM radius of their physical location, to discover those in need who are nearby and possibly provide them with the needed resources.

We believe that our project will provide the necessary support for communities nationwide, and will benefit a lot of people in our communities, especially the underserved in tough times like these.
